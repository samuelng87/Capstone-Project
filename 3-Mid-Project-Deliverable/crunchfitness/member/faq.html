We’d love if you opt in to stay up to date with Crunch (you’ll receive exclusive special offers and invitations, win awesome prizes and much more!) but the choice is yours. We do however ask that you agree to our terms and conditions which covers your entry into your Club and ensures we can serve you and our existing members best. Please Note: The additional $1 fortnight fee clause isn't applicable to your Free Pass even though you'll need to agree to it to proceed.

Your buddy can be the same person or a different person each time. You'll need to check your buddy in to the club when you check in and ensure they follow our guests and club etiquette to keep everyone safe and happy. Our experience tells us that having a workout buddy increases your results by at least 50%.

                Our memberships are designed to keep your initial investment simple so that nothing stands in the way of you getting started. To enrol you will pay an Enrolment fee, this sets you up as a member. Then you will need to cover your membership fees (Pro-rata membership fees) for the number of days from your start date to your first direct debit billing date. And lastly, we collect a Final month's membership fee so if you decide to end your membership, your final month is already covered and we can stop charges immediately.

                Consider your membership payment cycle a constant reminder of the importance of making your fitness and well-being a priority in life. Weekly membership fees are billed every fortnight (2 weeks in advance) along with a pay-as-you-go billing fee of $1. To ensure our clubs are well maintained and we can invest in equipment and programming up-grades, an annual Up-keep fee of $44.90 will be applied 90 days after your membership has started and then annually thereafter. We find our loyal members understand the value of this upkeep fee and can best budget this in at this time throughout their journey.

But here you are; there's your weekly membership fees, your fortnightly pay-as-you-go processing fee $1, your annual Up-keep fee $44.90, one-off Freeze Fee $15 and a Direct Debit rejection fee $7.50.

              <p>
                We know life happens and there may be a need to take a 'pause break'. You can put your membership on-hold (freeze) for the following reasons; Travel, Medical Emergency, Pregnancy and Military Deployment and supporting documentation is required. You can apply for a minimum of 4 weeks up to a maximum of 12 weeks and this is a one-time option in each 12-month period. To action this you just pay a one-off Freeze fee of $15 and we'll stop your fortnightly memberships fees and automatically restart them on the agreed date.

                Let's be honest, it's going to be hard to let you go! But that's no reason to make it impossible or feel like a bad breakup. Many of our members return to Crunch so we get it, our memberships are intended to make it easy for you to stop until you decide to come back.
                If your membership is go month to month, you've already covered your last month of fees. So as long as you come in to the club and submit your cancellation request in time for us to stop the next billing (2 days prior to the direct debit day) we'll immediately stop any further payments while you still get to enjoy 30 days of Crunch.
